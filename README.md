# Landing-Page
This is the main project I will create after learning CSS and HTML on the OdinProject
I will look back one day and remember this day, when my son was awake using my phone, while I was busy coding....actually learning how to code.
In this project, amo gonna create a landing page with the guidelines given in the course. I will only use HTML and CSS
